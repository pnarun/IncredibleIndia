        <p>A pristine green expanse ringed by the mist-shrouded Himalayas and a dense cover of oak, deodar, pine and
            conifers, Dharamsala (Dharamshala), in Himachal Pradesh, is a secluded natural retreat. While its pristine
            beauty leaves you in awe, its rugged terrain is ideal for adventure sports like trekking, paragliding or
            mountain climbing. A mesmeric journey in the pretty toy train that meanders through picturesque scenery is
            an added attraction.<span id="dots">...</span>
            <span id="more">Dharamsala is renowned as the home of the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan Buddhist leader, and is a
                popular centre of Buddhism. Dotted with colourful monasteries, it offers tourists a great opportunity to
                meditate and soak in the serenity and tranquillity of the surroundings. A major attraction is one of the
                most beautiful cricket stadiums in the world that has hosted a number of international and Indian
                Premier League (IPL) matches.
                <br>
                Tourists can take nature walks through verdant landscapes or enjoy a picnic spread along the banks of
                the lakes here. Quaint churches nestled in groves and ancient temples greet you at most turns. The heart
                of Dharamsala beats in its bustling and vibrant markets that are a riot of colour and activity.
                <br>
                From exquisite multi-hued Tibetan Buddhist thangka paintings and miniature Buddha statues to singing
                bowls and Tibetan handicrafts, the bazaars have a fine selection on display. As you shop to your heart's
                content, don't forget to sample authentic Tibetan delicacies like thukpa (a soupy noodle dish), momos,
                golden fried baby corn, mittha (local sweet prepared with rice and raisins) etc.
                <br>
                To get an overview of the uniquely rich culture of the city, which is often fondly called the Little
                Tibet, tourists can set on a museum trail or visit the famous Norbulingka Institute that is said to be
                the gatekeeper of the art and culture of Tibetan Buddhism. You can also observe local artisans
                practicing the art forms of thangka painting and applique, statue-making and decorative wood carving,
                wood painting, weaving and tailoring.
                <br>
                Dharamsala was the summer vacation retreat for Britishers and grew as a Tibetan settlement in 1959, when
                the Dalai Lama was allowed by the then Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, to stay in McLeodganj,
                in Upper Dharamsala.</span>
