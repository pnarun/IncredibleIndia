    <!-- Description -->
    <div class="description">
        <p>Planned by Vidyadhar Bhattacharya, Jaipur holds the distinction of being the first planned city of India.
            Renowned globally for its coloured gems, the capital city of Rajasthan combines the allure of its ancient
            history with all the advantages of a metropolis. The bustling modern city is one of the three corners of the
            golden triangle that includes Delhi, Agra and Jaipur.
            <span id="dots">...</span>
            <span id="more">The story goes that in 1876, the Prince of Wales visited India on a tour. Since the colour
                pink was symbolic of hospitality, Maharaja Ram Singh of Jaipur painted the entire city pink. The pink
                that colours the city makes for a marvellous spectacle to behold. Jaipur rises up majestically against
                the backdrop of the forts Nahargarh, Jaigarh and Garh Ganesh Temple.
                <br>
                Jaipur traces back its origins to 1727 when it was established by Jai Singh II, the Raja of Amber. He
                shifted his capital from Amber to the new city because of the rapidly-growing population and an
                increasing water scarcity. Noted architect Vidyadhar Bhattacharya used the established principles of
                Vastu Shastra to build the city. <br>
                <b>Hawa Mahal</b> Hawa Mahal, literally the Palace of Winds, was built in 1799 by the poet king Sawai Pratap Singh as a
                summer retreat for him and his family. It also served as a place where the ladies of the royal household
                could observe everyday life without being seen themselves. This unique five-storey structure is a blend
                of Hindu and Islamic architecture, and the exterior, with its small latticed windows (called jharokhas),
                resembles the crown of Lord Krishna. The windows also serve as an air-conditioner of sorts, blowing cool
                air throughout the palace, making it the perfect retreat during summers. Built from pink sandstone, the
                Hawa Mahal is Jaipurâ€™s iconic landmark and visitors can view its complete magnificence from outside,
                from across the road. However, it is also possible to climb right up to the top for a wonderful view
                from the windows. Today, the Mahal is maintained by the Archaeological Department of the Government of
                Rajasthan and also houses an archaeological museum in the courtyard. <br>
                <b>Jal Mahal</b> One of the most wonderful sights in Jaipur is the beautiful Jal Mahal or Lake Palace. The light, sand
                coloured stone walls and the deep blue of the water make for a wonderful contrast. The palace appears to
                float in the centre of Man Sagar Lake, where its magnificent exteriors can be enjoyed by tourists.
