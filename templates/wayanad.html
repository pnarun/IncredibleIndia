    <div class="description">
        <p>A coffer of coffee, cardamom and tea plantations, which envelope the land with lush emerald greenery and fill
            the air with a heady aroma, Wayanad, in Kerala, is one of the most beautiful regions of the state. Perched
            on the southernmost tip of the Deccan plateau, Wayanad boasts dense forests that are one of the 20 reserves
            in UNESCOâ€™s World Network of Biosphere Reserves. <span id="dots">...</span>
            <span id="more">A bridge to neighbouring states, the hills of Wayanad are
                connected with Bandipur (Karnataka) and Mudumalai (Tamil Nadu) to form a massive landmass that helps the
                wildlife of the region to freely move around in their natural surroundings. For the discerning
                traveller,
                Wayanad offers ideal picnic spots next to gurgling mountain streams, serene lakes and cascading
                waterfalls.
                While adventure-seekers can opt for mountain biking, camping, trekking, speed boating, zorbing and
                ziplining, wildlife enthusiasts can choose from wildlife safaris, forest trails or treehouses. Wayanad
                is
                also home to Edakkal Caves, where one of the oldest signs of human settlement are preserved. Leading
                tourist
                destinations of Mysore, Bengaluru, Kannur, Ooty and Coorg are close by.</span>
